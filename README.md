# üí∏ NestEgg ‚Äì Your Financial Flow, Finally in Focus

**NestEgg** is an intelligent personal finance management app designed to help users track income, organize bills, monitor debt, and gain weekly financial clarity ‚Äî without needing spreadsheets or guesswork.

Built and maintained by **Zayviana Singletary**, NestEgg is more than a budgeting tool ‚Äî it's a full-stack product demonstrating modern SDLC practices, database planning, scalable architecture, and future-ready AI integration.

## üß≠ Why I Built NestEgg

Like many people navigating changing pay cycles and multiple bills, I wanted a system that could:
- Tell me **what to pay and when**, based on **real weekly income**
- Help me manage everything from **credit cards** to **Klarna/Affirm** to **subscriptions**
- Recommend **smart financial actions** based on what's due and what I earned

So I created **NestEgg** ‚Äî a financial app that makes your income and obligations work together, not against each other.
